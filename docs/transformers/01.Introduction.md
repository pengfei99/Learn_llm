# Introduction of transformers

Transformer is one of the most powerful models ever created in Natural Language Processing. In this tutorial, we explain
first the `benefits of transformers compared to recurrent neural networks`. Then, we will build our understanding 
of Transformers. At last, we will walk you through some real-world case scenarios by using `Huggingface transformers`.


## Some background

Before the transformers, the most efficient models in the NLP field are the `Recurrent Network`. 

Recurrent network employ the encoder-decoder architecture, and we mainly use them when dealing with tasks where 
both the input and outputs are sequences in some defined ordering. Some of the greatest applications of recurrent 
networks are `machine translation` and `time series data modeling`.
